## üìÉ Description 

This project continously verifies if the following assets have been updated with additions and/or removals during the **last 24 hours**:
- Azure roles

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up this project against your own Entra tenant

Setting up this project against a specific tenant can be useful to include custom roles and permissions in the monitoring.

The project can be configured against a specific Entra tenant as follows:

1. Fork this project.

2. In your tenant, create a service principal with a new client secret, and take note of the following:
    1. The tenant ID associated with the service principal
    2. The service principal's application/client ID
    3. The service principal's client secret

3. Grant the following application permissions to the service principal:
    1. [`RoleManagement.Read.Directory`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#rolemanagementreaddirectory) (required to read Entra role definitions)
    2. [`Application.Read.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#applicationreadall) (required to read the definitions of application permissions)

4. In the forked project, configure a GitHub secret with the following name and value, replacing `__PLACEHOLDER__` with the values collected in step 2:

| GitHub secret name | Value (string) | 
|---|---|
| `SP_CREDENTIALS_ENTRA` | `{"tenant_id": "__PLACEHOLDER__", "client_id": "__PLACEHOLDER__", "client_secret": "__PLACEHOLDER__"}` |

**Note**: in a tenant with a default configuration, service principals have permissions to read Azure role definitions by default. Therefore, the service principal should **not** require any additional Azure permissions.
